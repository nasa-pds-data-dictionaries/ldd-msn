   version                1.5
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Preserved
   description            The mission_phase_name identifies a time period within the mission.
   nillable               true
   permissible value - value meaning
      ATLO - The ATLO mission phase (Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations) is the time of spacecraft and instrument assembly and test. During this phase data products are generated using flight hardware. They are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review. 
      CRUISE - The cruise mission phase is from the time of escape from Earth's orbit through the time of entry into Mars' orbit. Some data products may be generated during this time, including instrument checkout data.
      DEVELOPMENT - The development mission phase refers to the period of data processing software development and testing, before instruments are integrated with the spacecraft. Data products generated during this phase are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review.
      SURFACE MISSION - The surface mission phase is the time from arrival at Mars through the end of surface operations, including the primary mission and any extended missions that may take place.
      TEST - The test mission phase is not a time period but a placeholder for the mission_phase_name value, used for data products generating during all project tests such as ORTs, SVTs and thread tests. Data products generated in this way are usually not part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review.

   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The start_local_mean_solar_time_sol element specifies the number of solar days elapsed since a reference day (e.g. the day on which a landing vehicle set down) for local mean solar time (LMST). Days are measured in rotations of the planet in question from midnight to midnight. The reference day is '0', as Landing day is Sol 0. If before Landing day, then value will be less than or equal to '0'and can be negative.
