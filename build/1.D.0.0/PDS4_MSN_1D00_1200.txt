      ## CHANGE LOG ##
      1.0.0.0
      - Initial version
      
      1.1.0.0
      - Upgraded to v1B00 of the IM.
      - Re-classified this dictionary as a Discipline Dictionary, instead of Mission Dictionary.
      - Renamed Orbital_Mission_Information to Orbital_Mission, Surface_Mission_Information to Surface_Mission
      
      1.2.0.0
      - Upgraded to v1D00 of the IM.
      - Add instrument_clock_start. This is the value of the clock returned by
        the instrument at the beginning of the observation. This may differ from
        the spacecraft clock due to several factors such as clock drift, or
        differences in definition of start time (for example, spacecraft clock
        might be when an image was commanded, but instrument clock might be
        after autoexposure or autofocus processes).
      - Add instrument_start_time. This is instrument_clock_start converted to UTC.
      - Updated the definition for start_sol_number to allow a primary sol to be 
        defined for mosaic products inplace of the actual starting sol value.
